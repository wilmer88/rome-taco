### quiero tacos


food service worker.The aplication helps customers and buisness owner save time
by allowing the customer to order tacos ahead of leaving their current location and also helps the seller by not slowing down or stoping their current order.  All the app does the math recive the order to be prepared asap and the aplication does all the work with the math/chargest and informing both parties of the order cost/bill . No more missed or miss understood when talking over the phone or screaming thru foodtruck windows; just a smooth ride for both sides.

quiero tacos was buildt as a passion project with the idea of solving, helping and enjoying the food truck industry, home cooks, and food service worker.
### technoligies, functuality , fetures
The front end is built with an App.js file that uses react-router-dom for state,props, Routes, Server Rendering and other Metheds. I built the appclication having in mind current best practices from React, bulma frame work, custom CSS,  Javascript functuality and libarys with a spriknle of jquery to help out on one or two things that were holding back production. I designed the aplication to be mobile responsive for all mobile devises. 
The Aplication is Currently in production and hosted by Github and Heroku; Heroku enables the applicaction to store data from the backend. The backend is incorpriated with Node.JS, many NPM packages like Morgan for logging errors; nth-check for parseing and compiling; axios for making API calls; svgo for optimizing files and many more node packages. I chose MongoDB as my application data platform/database; The data is modeled using Mongoose. Middleware is used along with express- working as my server sofware for comunicating with the front end, the controller/routes/mini app, that allows me to communicate the database. I also incoperated json web tokens, the use of headers, bcrypt and envierment variables for hashing passwords and adding a bit of cyber security. Inserted Athorization, Authentication as protection to some application access.
